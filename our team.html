                            Coder is a good definition for Scott. We sometimes call him our resident hacker because if there is a code he can’t write, then he just may explode. Scott specialized in platform customization and programmatic development that plus smiles on our client’s faces. He brings so much knowledge and experience to our website design and development projects that we, at times, have to slow him down.
